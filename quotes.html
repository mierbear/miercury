        <div class="item">
        <ul>
            <li>Your thoughts determine your life.</li>
            <li>You're better off fishing in your own mind.</li>
            <li>The only thing you're in control of are your own thoughts.</li>
            <li>There's not enough room in your mind for some other entity's thoughts.</li>
            <li>Fear is not a natural state of man.</li>
            <li>How can you put forth your best fruit if you are not put forth within yourself first?</li>
            <li>You can only be in hell with your own permission.</li>
            <li>The devil makes work of idle hands.</li>
            <li>Become who you are, become who you want to be and who you should be, before you never do.</li>
            <li>The only thing the devil wants is for you to suffer like it is.</li>
            <li>The only thing there is in this life is to purify your soul, so that you're not afraid of death.</li>
            <li>The angels weep for men and women failing to accept the challenge of integrity.</li>
            <li>When we experience tears, our souls become like babies.</li>
            <li>There are no coincidences. Nothing is random.</li>
            <li>Unless you turn and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.</li>
            <li>Hatred is reserved for fist fighting the demons.</li>
            <li>Forgive them for they know not what they do.</li>
            <li>Each and every action are equally drastic, therefore no action is drastic. So you don't have to look at something as hard to do.</li>
            <li>It takes control to be addicted. It takes more control to keep it in you than to push it all out.</li>
            <li>Strict adherence to oneâ€™s own free will, is the fall.</li>
            <li>The fear of death distresses a man with a guilty conscience, but the man with a good witness within himself longs for death as for life.</li>
            <li>Men are second only to God, which is something that the forgetting of is the end of your life prematurely. Which is usually at the beginning.</li>
            <li>There is no free will in the world, unless you get less of the world.</li>
            <li>Restoration of faith is the knowledge of real free will, which is obedience. Free will is actually obedience, but you are only willing to and enthusiastic of obedience when you have faith to back it up.</li>
