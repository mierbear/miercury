        <p>Pacific Purgatory (the community i host) has no connection<br>

        it was a title i chose on a whim because i liked their music<br>
        and it just kinda stuck there overtime.<br>
        <br>
        ever since, i met a lot of friends that i love. :3<br>
        love you pp & pp <3

    <div class="char-info mier-why-info">
        <p>i honestly dont know..<br>
        it just started as me drawing mier with different hair/eye colors for fun, and then drawing him with black hair because it was easier to just fill in the hair to render it quickly, then so on. but then as time passed i just slowly realized i clearly havent studied hair structure at all and just had a 'comfort hair' to draw all the time, and even if i try not to make it like mier's hair, the general shape/style still bleeds into other hairstyles i draw..<br>
        (which can be very clear to see once you scroll down more lol)<br>
        <br>
        so now i just let it be and accepted that there are 'multiple versions' of mier hehe</p>

    <div class="char-info aurelius-info" id="aureliusInfo">
        <h1>Aurelius</h1>
        <p>The third son, the silent, shy and curious brother.</p>
        <br>
        <p>● The heart of the group. Despite the overwhelmingly distressing situation they are in (and being the first to cry), he always sees the bright side of things and always relays it to his brothers</p>
        <p>● He is very forgiving of wrongdoers and can be a bit naive, which his brothers have to tell him off from time to time.</p>
        <p>● In his free time, he is often seen exploring on his own in the woods inspecting insects/creatures.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="char-info rufus-info" id="rufusInfo">
        <h1>Rufus</h1>
        <p>The fourth son, the agile, headstrong and quick-tempered brother.</p>
        <br>
        <p>● The hothead of the group, he can't control his anger. (lol)</p>
        <p>● Despite being the youngest, he is very protective over Aurelius as if he were the older brother.</p>
        <p>● Him and Ignatius are very competitive against each other, frequently getting into petty fights, only to make up 5 minutes later.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="char-info ignatius-info" id="ignatiusInfo">
        <h1>Ignatius</h1>
        <p>The second son, the loud, energetic and obnoxious brother.</p>
        <br>
        <p>● The mischief of the group. He likes to playfully tease his younger brothers, angering Rufus and scaring Aurelius. (mostly angering Rufus)</p>
        <p>● Very active and hates dull moments. He's a bit of an adrenaline junkie.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="char-info brutus-info" id="brutusInfo">
        <h1>Brutus</h1>
        <p>The first son, the strong, stern, calculating and stoic brother.</p>
        <br>
        <p>● The leader and brain of the group, usually scolds Ignatius for misbehaving. (and Rufus for following along)</p>
        <p>● At nighttime, he stays awake for as long as he can until he falls asleep, watching over his brothers.</p>
        <p>● Discreetly favors Aurelius over the other two. He tries his best to guide him in everything he knows in his knowledge as the oldest brother, rather than in physical capability.</p>
