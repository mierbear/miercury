                        <p>● The heart of the group. Despite the overwhelmingly distressing situation they are in (and being the first to cry), he always sees the bright side of things and always relays it to his brothers</p>
                        <p>● He is very forgiving of wrongdoers and can be a bit naive, which his brothers have to tell him off from time to time.</p>
                        <p>● In his free time, he is often seen exploring on his own in the woods inspecting insects/creatures.</p>

                        <p>● Despite being the youngest, he is very protective over Aurelius as if he were the older brother.</p>
                        <p>● Him and Ignatius are very competitive against each other, frequently getting into petty fights, only to make up 5 minutes later.</p>

                        <br>
                        <p>● The mischief of the group. He likes to playfully tease his younger brothers, angering Rufus and scaring Aurelius. (mostly angering Rufus)</p>
                        <p>● Very active and hates dull moments. He's a bit of an adrenaline junkie.</p>

                        <br>
                        <p>● The leader and brain of the group, usually scolds Ignatius for misbehaving. (and Rufus for following along)</p>
                        <p>● At nighttime, he stays awake for as long as he can until he falls asleep, watching over his brothers.</p>
                        <p>● Discreetly favors Aurelius over the other two. He tries his best to guide him in everything he knows in his knowledge as the oldest brother, rather than in physical capability.</p>
